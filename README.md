# 🍌 Nano Banana 2 Prompt Gallery (Preview) 🍌


## 🍌 Introduction
awesome-nano-banana-2-images is a curated, community-driven collection of high-quality prompts and stunning outputs generated with the **Nano Banana 2 (Google Gemini 3.0 Pro Image)** model, currently accessible through *third-party preview APPs*.  
This repository aims to help creators, researchers, and prompt engineers better understand how to craft effective prompts for the model during its pre-release phase.

## 📌 What This Repository Contains
- Community-shared prompts that produce high-quality or interesting results  
- Example images generated via preview-access Nano Banana 2 endpoints  
- Notes, tips, and reverse-prompt insights from real-world usage  

## 🎯 Purpose
This project serves as a practical reference for anyone experimenting with the Nano Banana 2 model. By collecting public examples and prompts from across the community, we aim to:
- Showcase what the model can achieve  
- Explore prompt patterns that lead to strong outputs  
- Help users learn and iterate faster
